# Graph-Theory-Project
This is my 3rd year graph theory project. For this project I was required to design a database for a timetabling system for a third level institute. The database stores information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers and work hours.

### Understanding the problem

#### What data needs to be stored?

### Understanding Neo4J
Before trying to solve the timetabling system problem it is important to first understand Neo4J and how it works.

#### What is Neo4J?
[Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database management system. Graph databases are catagorised as NoSQL, or not only SQL, databases. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not follow a set schema. This makes the data more flexible which allows for a more simple design. Graph databases are particularly useful for storing connections, or relationships, between data.

#### How does Neo4J store data?
All data is a Neo4J database is represented as one of the following five:

1. Nodes
2. Relationships
3. Relationship types
4. Labels
5. Properties

### Finding a solution

#### What functionality is required?

### Obtaining the data

### Using the system

### Conclusion
